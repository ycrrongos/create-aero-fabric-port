<p>Sable is an intrusive library mod for Minecraft that adds my take on interactive moving block structures, called "sub-levels". Sub-levels contain normal Minecraft chunks, entities, and block-entities, but exist at a separate dynamic position and orientation within Minecraft levels. My goal is to maximize compatibility, performance, and immersion of interacting with sub-levels, as simply as possible.</p>

### Compatibility Warning

Sable is an incredibly intrusive mod. It makes extensive use of mixins, and is prone to extensive compatibility issues
with other mods.

### Developers

For adding optional, and simple compatibility to a mod to function alongside Sable,
view [Sable Companion](https://github.com/ryanhcode/sable-companion).

View the [Sable Developer Wiki](https://github.com/ryanhcode/sable/wiki) for documentation and guides.
